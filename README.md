# Kinect-Based-Super-Mario
Srishti 2020
## Abstract
  Aim of the project is to build "super mario game" and integerate kinect as an interaction technique medium, thereby using your own body as a controller for super mario.
## Motivation
 Every year globally, people spend huge amount of time and money playing video games. Most people who engage in video game play choose to do so voluntarily because it is fun and     they enjoy it so far .video games were rated by how well the game satisfies our psychological needs
 
 Autonomy -(flexibility over movement and strategies ,Choice over tasks and goals , and rewards that provide feedback and not control)
 Competence-extent to which taska provide ongoing challenges
 Relatedness- interaction between players

 adressing the above parameters ,we thought of introducing PHYSICAL aspect of it by transferring control to players body rather than keyboard. This would certainly increase .
 
 Presence - the extent to which the player feels within the environment as opposed to being outside the game manipulating the controls, and
 Intuitive-controls- The extent to which th controls make sense and don't interfere with feeling of presence, making it vividly interactive and acceptable.
## Limitation
1.	The kinect sensor is sensitive to external infrared source (Sunlight).
2.	It requires lot of space as one needs to stand at least 7 ft. away from the sensor
3.	Low quality graphics of the game
4.	Motion is detected in two dimensions only
## Future improvement
1.	Kinectâ€™s microphone can be assigned some of the controls of the game
2.	Screen Resolution of gameplay can be increased
3.	Masking of background can be done in order to prevent unwanted structure detections.
4.	Game can be made multiplayer
