## Motivation
 Every year globally, people spend huge amount of time and money playing video games. Most people who engage in video game play choose to do so voluntarily because it is fun and     they enjoy it so far .video games were rated by how well the game satisfies our psychological needs
 
 Autonomy -(flexibility over movement and strategies ,Choice over tasks and goals , and rewards that provide feedback and not control)
 Competence-extent to which taska provide ongoing challenges
 Relatedness- interaction between players

 adressing the above parameters ,we thought of introducing PHYSICAL aspect of it by transferring control to players body rather than keyboard. This would certainly increase .
 
 Presence - the extent to which the player feels within the environment as opposed to being outside the game manipulating the controls, and
 Intuitive-controls- The extent to which th controls make sense and don't interfere with feeling of presence, making it vividly interactive and acceptable.
